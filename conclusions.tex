\section{Produced Improvement}
Even in a complex field as e-health, because sensible data, different country legislations and lots of specific standards each one with pro and cons coming from past years of un-coordinated developement. The current technological landscape is slowly converging among formats, interfaces and protocols, thanks to the succesful spread of distributed systems and web services.\\
Starting from proprietary softwares each one partecipating to an e-health system, as the Cardioline one described in \ref{chapter:cardioline_specific_ecosystem}, bounded to each customer company or organization and ending up with a cloud based system (see chapter \ref{chapter:implemented_solution}) which strongly uses international standard to store data and communicate with external services and devices breaking physical barriers in time and space, can be considered a consistent improvement.\\
Especially for companies which work with digital healthcare data, is important to underline the real possibility to provide each one softwares, even the legacy ones, with ad hoc modules to map their data into modern standards and EHR repository compliant formats, without radically changing their currrent workflow.
The adoption of standard communication architecture is at the same way very useful to enable interactions with the widest possible set of external devices, decreasing the time needed to complete specific tasks.\\ \\
The developement of this prototype is valuable not only for Cardioline as a company but also as an experiment to break the current digital healthcare barriers.\\
Concluding, the economic and time effort required for this kind of evolution, has to be as lowest as possible, in particular dealing with e-health which is already strongly limited by countries and organizations burocracy. Hence the usage of cloud computing environment due to their optimized resource consuption and cost brings a great technological and business advantage.

\section{Future Develompent}
Once countries EHR will be opened to third-party stakeholders, the prototype developed in Cardioline will be immediately able to send its own produced documents through an appropriate communication channel.
Cardioline is still focused on improving the developed prototype. To respect the future European Law about privacy and sensible data it will be necessary to implement a strong-authentication mechanism and enable cardiologists to sign digitally reviewed exams.\\ \\
Furthermore a deep testing has to be done in order to analyse the system behaviour in case of huge traffic and resources demand.
