\subsection{Architecture}
Since Amazon Elastic Beanstalk has been used as the core component to organize the system, it has been possibile to use an Infrastructure as a Service grade of customization, with an easier configuration and building phase as if the system were Platform as a Service instead.\\
As shown in the picture \ref{fig:architecture}, everything but the SES service is hosted in the eu-central-1 region in Frankfurt, which is divided into availability zones connected through low-latency links, in order to handle potential instance failures by replacing those failed with the standby ones, placed in a different availability zone.\\
