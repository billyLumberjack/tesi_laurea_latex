\subsection{Architecture}
\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Architecture Scheme}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}
Since Amazon Elastic Beanstalk (EB) has been used as the core component of the n-tier system, it has been possible to use an infrastructure as a service (IaaS \ref{paragraph:Iaas}) grade of customization, with an easier configuration and building phase as if the system was platform as a service (PaaS \ref{paragraph:Paas}) instead.\\
As shown in picture \ref{fig:architecture}, everything but the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES \cite{AmazonSes}) service is hosted in the eu-central-1 region in Frankfurt to reduce latency, minimize costs and keep healthcare data in an European law venue, as in production would be.
The region is divided into availability zones connected to each other with low-latency links, so to handle potential instance failures by replacing them with the standby ones located in a different availability zone.\\
EB handles the WebServer instances: one for the EcgWebApp, more details in section \ref{subsection:ecgwebapp} and the other one for WebReceiver,section \ref{subsection:webreceiver}. The interaction is then allowed to authenticated users bounded to their capabilities and role.\\
The persistency is achieved by a Relational Database Service (RDS) running Amazon Aurora DB, a compatible MySql Database organized with a master write replica and several read replicas.
Furthermore, RDS provides a standby and synchronous Database, hosted in another availability zone, that is ready to become the new master in case of failure of the current master.\\
All the assets and static files are read and written from/to AWS S3 relative bucket.\\
The notification System is triggered by DB events and carried on by AWS Lambda functions using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) as delivery service to final users. This service is not available in the Frankfurt region hence, the Ireland region was chosen.


\section{Ecg Workflow}
Resting Electrocardiogram (\ref{paragraph:Resting}) are uploaded from different device types such as, mobile phones, desktop computers and Cardioline specific machines to EcgWebApp through a specific REST (details about REpresentational State Transter\ref{paragraph:REST}) interface, the exam is stored in a \textit{pending} state and every associated physician notified for the anamnesis provisioning.
The user interface for a physician with anamnesis providing rights logged in is displayed in fig.\ref{fig:todo_anamnesi}.
Once the history of a \textit{pending} exam has been supplied (screenshot at fig.\ref{fig:aggiunta_anamnesi}) it passes to a \textit{ready} state, at this point every associated doctor with review role and permission, usually a cardiologist, is notified and allowed to write its own conclusion, as showed in figure \ref{fig:aggiunta_anamnesi}, and eventually ask for a second opinion from another expert. The exam state is finally set to \textit{confirmed} and the patient doctor notified.

\section{Interoperability related components (o tiers ?)}
The biggest contribution has been provided to the architecture components which interact with an external service, as it is possible to observe in figure \ref{fig:architecture}, they are mainly two, EcgWebApp (\ref{subsection:ecgwebapp}) for resting and cardiac stress test and WebReceiver (\ref{subsection:webreceiver}) for the Holter methodology.
\subsection{Web and Application Server}
\paragraph{EcgWebApp}
\label{paragraph:ecgwebapp}
It's a 3-tier deployment architecture (\ref{fig:tiers_diagram}) based on Microsoft ASP .NET MVC framework, its main components are,
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{WebBased UI and REST} - client interface
    \item \textit{WebServer} - handles http requests dispatching and routing to AppServer modules (IIS)
    \item \textit{Application Server} - ASP .NET Framework based business logic
    \item \textit{RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)} - Amazon Aurora and Amazon Simple Cloud Storage Service (S3)
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:tiers_diagram}
\end{figure}
The MVC \textit{(Model View Controller)} paradigm allows to isolate the domain specific logic from the input and presentation ones, making testing and development easier. \cite{mvc}\\
In this specific context the \textit{model} includes objects as exams and patients and their relations, which are mapped to MySql Database Entities by Entity Framework (EF), an open source object-relational-mapping tool (ORM) developed by Microsoft, in order to work without taking care of the underlying database tables and columns where data are actually stored. Indeed developers deal with an higher level of abstraction \cite{wikipedia_ef}.\\
The \textit{view} manages data presentation, serving html pages or json formatted data, as show in figure \ref{fig:app_resource_pattern}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/app_resource_pattern}
    \caption{Each application resource has been implemented following this pattern}
    \label{fig:app_resource_pattern}
\end{figure}
WebServices included in EcgWebApp are based on the ASP .NET WebApi Framework, a REST interface triggers a specific action on a resource depending on the URL parameters and the HTTP verb used.
